<h1>Workflow</h1>
<h2>Unit tests</h2>
<p>
    You like basejumping from buildings in China ? You like stratopheric jump ? 
    You like refactoring without unit tests ? Well, it's your choice...
</p>
<h2>A quick view before madness</h2>
<p>
    At first, try this command :
    <pre>$ php console.php mondrian:digraph ~/MyProject</pre>
    As I said, check the ratio class/interface and the ratio of contract method
    on concrete methods to evaluate the level of abstraction. The lower they are,
    the difficultier the refactoring will be.
</p>
<h2>Spaghetti incident</h2>
<p>
    Second, try this command :
    <pre>$ php console.php mondrian:spaghetti --cycle ~/MyProject</pre>
    If there is no cluster (strongly connected components), you are a lucky 
    developer. If not, I recommand you to break the circle. 
</p>
<p>
    What are these classes ?
</p>
<h3>Model classes</h3>
<p>
    hmmm... you have to rethink and abstract the model, add some interfaces
    to decouple these classes. It can be tricky and you have perhaps to 
    talk to the business people what they really want to do ? 
</p>
<h3>Service classes</h3>
<p>
    There are good chances you need a Mediator pattern to "bind" these colleagues
    to work together. Don't forget to make an interface for this Mediator.
</p>
<h2>Circles of confusion</h2>
<p>
    Third, try this command :
    <pre>$ php console.php mondrian:spaghetti --strategy=concrete ~/MyProject</pre>
    Is there one big ball of mud ? Well, you can check if there would be false edges
    because of method name collision. You can add comment with
    <pre>// @mondrian ignoreCallTo MyClass::notCalledMethod</pre>
    in front of method. But wait ! This could mean there is a common contract
    between all these classes. Try to add the --cycle option to see the most
    intricated components but don't try to break it now.
</p>
<h2>Narrow the good edges</h2>
<p>
    Fourth, try this command :
    <pre>$ php console.php mondrian:hidden ~/MyProject</pre>
    It helps you to find if there is really a non-typed parameter between two
    classes. Therefore, you start to add new dependencies, go to first stage.
</p>
<p>
    Since there is no type, add new interfaces or abstract classes.
</p>
<h2>What is really important</h2>
<p>
    Fifth, now you have a better matches between source code and digraph, 
    you could try this command :
    <pre>$ php console.php mondrian:centrality:depend ~/MyProject</pre>
    It tells you what is the most critical component. It is not SRP since
    it should have too many responsibilities.
</p>
<p>
    And this too :
    <pre>$ php console.php mondrian:centrality:used ~/MyProject</pre>
    It tells you what is "on the top" of this package and what is "under the facade".
    This is the time to use a Facade pattern perhaps.
</p>
<h2>Loop over...</h2>
<p>
    Sixth, it's time to show all dependencies with this command :
    <pre>$ php console.php mondrian:spaghetti --strategy=any --cycle ~/MyProject</pre>
    Beware, Cthulhu is behind you if you have many classes in a cluster.
</p>
<h2>... and over</h2>
<p>
    Seventh, you can carefully eliminates bad edges with :
    <pre>$ php console.php mondrian:cycle ~/MyProject</pre>
    Check the collision, create new interfaces and go to stage two or three. 
</p>
<h2>May the force be with you</h2>
<p>
    As you can see, there is no magic behind refactoring. It is an iterative process
    but with this tools, you can check at each step if you go in the right direction. 
    Don't forget to branch over and over with GIT it is made for that !
</p>
<p>
    It is only an example. Your process may be very different, depending of
    what kind of source code you have.
