Ok guyz, you have a master degree in [Graph Theory][4], you follow [Law of Demeter][2]
and you live on [S.O.L.I.D][3] principles ?

Let's have some Fun ! (^Ï‰^)

## What
It is a set of CLI tools to help you to analyse and refactor highly coupled classes.
As you know Law of Demeter and S.O.L.I.D guidances, you need your classes loosely
coupled. And for this, there is one only rule : **ABSTRACTION**

This app provides some helpers to add some abstraction into concrete classes
with minimum pain.

## How


### Strongly Connected Components

### Highly coupled implementation
