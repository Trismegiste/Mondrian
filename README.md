# KandinskyBundle

Ok guyz, you have a master degree in [Graph Theory][4], you follow [Law of Demeter][2]
and you live on [S.O.L.I.D][3] principles ?

Let's have some Fun ! (^Ï‰^)

## What
It is a set Symfony2 commands to help you to analyse and refactor highly coupled classes.
As you know Law of Demeter and S.O.L.I.D guidances, you need your classes loosely
coupled. And for this, there is one only rule : **ABSTRACTION**

This bundle provides some helpers to add some abstraction into concrete classes
with minimum pain.

Currently, there is only one tool for [generation][1] but I'm working on a totally
new approch which involves the Graph Theory and the Strongly Connected Components.
